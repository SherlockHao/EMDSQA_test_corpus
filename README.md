# EMDSQA_test_corpus
We created a test corpus for speech quality assessment using speaker embeddings. This corpus has two goals:
1. Aim at the speech via online communication applications such as Zoom, Skype, Google Meet, Discord, etc. So the degradation types are typical communication distortions, which contain background noise (20%), packet loss (20%), non-linear processing (20%), and low-volume (20%).
2. Aim at the speech quality assessment using speaker embeddings. Both the matched reference and non-matched reference are provided for the degradation speech (i.e. non-matched reference stands for the reference speech is different from the degradation speech but from the same person).
